## Instructions

The aim of the game is for the player to not collide with the enemies on the board. 

For this to happen you can use the up,down,left and right keyboard buttons. 

If you reach the top of the board you win and you can pick if you want to play again or not. 

If you collide with an enemy you will automatically go on the start position of the game to play again.
